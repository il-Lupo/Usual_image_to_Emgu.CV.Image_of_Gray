# Usual_image_to_Emgu.CV.Image_of_Gray
With this small C# WinForms application, images can be selected; these are converted by the programme into a greyscale image and saved.

To the viewers of my YouTube video: In this folder you will find 2 C# files: One is FormMain.cs and the other is Converter.cs. Create a new C# project and include the Converter.cs class. Since I can only upload a certain number of megabytes on GitHub, I would like to ask those who want to create the programme to download the files “Emgu.CV”, “Emgu.CV.Bitmap”, and “Emgu.CV.runtime.windows” via Visual Studio's own NuGet package manager (version 4.4.0.4061 in each case). Also “Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell” for the file dialogues. The project must run on x86.
